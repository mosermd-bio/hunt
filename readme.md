# Microbiota-Host Genetics Interpreter (HUNT Study)

This Microbiota-Host Genetics Interpreter based on the HUNT study is a 100% client-side educational tool for researchers. Upload your 23andMe raw genome file to instantly compare your genotypes against the key replicated SNP–species associations from the two landmark 2026 *Nature Genetics* papers (Moksnes et al. HUNT study and Dekkers et al. Swedish cohorts). View a clean results table, personalized synopsis, and export to CSV — everything runs locally in your browser with zero data transmission.
